	Note: My balance approach is going to use a ratio defined by HP, Dps, dmg, range x 2 if T2 and 0.5 if T3 : Tech 2 equivalent and Tech 3 equivalent; if these ratios are near 2 the unit is balanced
		comment: the dps value is grabbed from the ingame UI calculation, if these are inaccurate we use balthazars real world dps debug mod 
		if speed is a defining factor of a unit it also gets taken into account, eg. cybran dreadnought
		the cost of a unit doesnt justify strength it will not be taken into account but rather be based on this ratio 
		
Tech 3 Heavy Destroyer:
	Note: All factions destroyers have equal stats except for Seraphim, this may change since equivalent units without factional quirks are boring.
		  The seraphims destroyers quirk is already perfect since its dps is much higher than the other destroyers - to adjust for the fact that it cant hit land effectively.
